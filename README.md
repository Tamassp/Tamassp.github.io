My software portfolio is under development. It will be ready in a few weeks.
Until then, I gathered the relevant information here:

<h2>Work experiences:</h2>
<br/>
<h3>Keyhole</h3>
<br/>
<p>I gained plenty of experience working at a startup company called <b>Keyhole</b>. Thanks to the cool team, I could be a part of the planning and development processes from day 1, allowing me to take responsibility of my work. I was mainly working with React and React native. We maintained and developed new features for a mobile and two web applications.</p>
